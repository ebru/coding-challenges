## Level 1

In the block of text below, find the longest substring that is the same in reverse.

As an example, if the input was "I like racecars that go fast" the answer would be "racecar".

## Level 2

Write code to find the first prime fibonacci number larger than a given minimum. For example, the first prime fibonacci number larger than 10 is 13.

For the second portion of this task, note that for the number 12 we consider the sum of the prime divisors to be 2 + 3 = 5. We do not include 2 twice even though it divides 12 twice.

Step 1. Use your code to compute the smallest prime fibonacci number greater than 227,000. Call this number X.

Step 2. The answer for this level is the sum of prime divisors of X + 1.

## Level 3

You must find all subsets of the array below, where the largest number is the sum of the remaining numbers.

{3, 4, 9, 14, 15, 19, 28, 37, 47, 50, 54, 56, 59, 61, 70, 73, 78, 81, 92, 95, 97, 99}

For example, for an input of:

(1, 2, 3, 4, 6)

the subsets would be

1 + 2 = 3 1 + 3 = 4 2 + 4 = 6 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

The answer is the number of subsets. In the above case the answer would be 4.
