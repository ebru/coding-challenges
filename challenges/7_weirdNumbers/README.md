## 7_weirdNumbers

In number theory, a weird number is a natural number that is abundant but not semiperfect, does match those 2 conditions:

1. The sum of the divisors (including 1, but not the number itself) of the tap number is greater than tap number itself
2. No subset of those divisors sums up to the tap number itself

Find the weird numbers up to 1000.
