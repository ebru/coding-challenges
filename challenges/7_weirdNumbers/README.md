## 7_weirdNumbers

In number theory, a weird number is a natural number that is abundant but not semiperfect, does match those 2 conditions:

1. The sum of the divisors (including 1 but not itself) of the number is greater than the number
2. No subset of those divisors sums to the number itself

Find the weird numbers up to 1000.
