## 2_smallestPositiveInteger

Write a function that, given an array of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in array.

**Sample Input 1** 
` [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2] `

**Output 1**
` 5 `

**Sample Input 2** 
` [1, 2, 3] `

**Output 2**
` 4 `

**Sample Input 3** 
` [−1, −3] `

**Output 3**
` 1 `

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].
