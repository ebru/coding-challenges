# Daily Coding Challenges

I have recently started to think about algorithm problems more and tried to solve them -kind of in a daily basis but no pressure, so let's say frequently- to improve my programming skills and these are my solutions to some of them that I found interesting and fun to solve.

Challenge questions are the ones that I have ran into in HackerRank or Codility so far. Check them out, they're cool.

The idea here is to try to gain a different point of view, challenge myself in thinking about efficieny more and give the new approaches a try.

If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, feel free to reach out to me. 

Happy coding!
