# Daily Coding Challenges

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ebrukye/daily-coding-challenges.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ebrukye/daily-coding-challenges)

I have recently started to think about algorithm problems more and tried to solve them -kind of in a daily basis but no pressure, so let's say frequently- to improve my programming skills and these are my solutions to some of them that I found interesting and fun to solve.

Some others can be found in my Repl/it account. I mostly start to solve the problems there for a quick action and store them later. I think it is fair enough to say that it has already been one of my favorite coding sites.

Challenge questions are the ones that I have ran into or heard from friends in HackerRank or Codility so far. Check them out, they're cool.

The idea here is to try to gain a different point of view, challenge myself in thinking about efficiency more and give the new approaches a try.

If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, feel free to reach out to me. 

Happy coding!
